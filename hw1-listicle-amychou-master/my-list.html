          When's the last time you've had an amazing Oreo Milkshake? It had been a while for me,
          but I wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I
          became reaquainted with the combination of thick milk and oreo.
          Oreo Milkshake are not so sweet as a normal drinks and not so boring as a others flavored
          carbonated water. The Oreo Milkshake at Bytes also have cream in them , which makes it a nice drink alternative for the times when you're feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine.

            Lemonade is a sweetened lemon-flavored beverage. There are varieties of lemonade found throughout the world. In North America and South Asia, cloudy lemonade dominates. It is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup or honey. 
            They have little bites  
            to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions. There's
            not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.

            Lemonade isn't exactly on campus and it's a short walk from there. (5 minutes total
            from the Gates Computer Science Building!)

            I can't tell you whether cold coffee has a particularly amazing drink, only
            because cold coffee is the only drink I've ever ordered as regular basis. I'm not
            even totally sure I know what a cold coffee is supposed to taste like. What I
            do know is the cold coffee I ordered on a whim from here was delicious.
